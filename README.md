Homework Brief:

"Your application should have a single class - Book - and should contain the following properties:

Title
Author
Genre
Provide the following functionality:

List all Books
Show an individual Book
Add a new Book to the Library.
Remove a Book from the Library


Extensions

Add a checked_out boolean property to the Book class.
When displaying a book, display whether it is checked in or checked out.
Style the app using CSS.

Advanced Extensions

Give the user the ability to update whether a book is checked in or out.
Because we can't use the PUT HTTP method you will need to use a form to send a POST route to /books/<index>. This form should use a checkbox or radio buttons to update the checked out status.
Anything else you can think of."
